                      preserves the original definition of North Carolina
                      Bar-B-Q which is pork cooked over live wood coals, ranging
                      from whole hog which is more popular in the eastern part
                      of the state, to pork shoulders and butts in the piedmont
                      and western parts of the state. North Carolina BAR-B-Q can
                      be found chopped, pulled, minced, and sliced with the
                      eastern section of North Carolina earning their reputation
                      for seasoning their BarBQ with a vinegar and pepper based
                      sauce, and the western section proving to be a sweeter
                      based sauce, and it is fitting for the piedmont sauce to be a
                      blend of the east and west sauces. A known fact is from
                      Manteo to Murphy, North Carolinians enjoy a pig picking for
                      most any occasion or celebration! Over time, gas and
                      electric pit cooked BAR-B-Q has also risen to popularity and
                      is included in the best of the best BAR-B-Q conversations.

                      The original North Carolina method of cooking pork BAR-B-Q
                      over wood coals is a pure process with the human skill
                      element determining the quality and taste of the finished
                      product. The wood coals create a distinct smoke flavor and
                      are controlled by the watchful eye and hand of the
                      pitmaster, using his/her experience and knowledge of
                      weather, temperature, humidity, wind, and wood moisture to
                      produce the best outcome of great BAR-B-Q. A more
                      modern process of smoked BAR-B-Q produces an excellent dish
                      by using technology, automated devices, and apps to
                      help simplify the process, versus the 10 to 12 hours of
                      continual attention, shoveling coals, and rewarding hard
                      work of the pitmaster.
